<h1>Stephanie Yanok</h1>

<p>Thanks for visiting my practice website. I'm taking a three month software engineering course and learning how to write computer code. So far, I have started learning about HTML and CSS, and look forward to learning more. In my free time, I like reading and going to the beach. My favorite color is green.</p>

<br>

<p>I have a big family and enjoy spending time with them. I've started growing vegetables in my backyard including tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, carrots and lettuce. I'm excited to learn about software engineering and start a new career.</p>
